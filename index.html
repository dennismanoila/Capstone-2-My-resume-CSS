                            in University. My only experience comes from a marketing job where 
                            I had to sell a course of Romanian Language to 12th grade pupils.Below you can observe a picture of me and my team:)

                        Being able to write code in <span class="prog-language">C/C++</span>. These were the first programming
                        languages I learned. Because of them, I am know able to perform procedural and object oriented
                        programming and I was able to build a solid base regarding Data Structures and Algorithms.
                        Also, I have a little bit of <span class="prog-language">C#</span> knowledge since,
                        I have studied some in my last highschool semester.

                        I am also able to do procedural and object oriented using <span class="prog-language">Python</span>
                        since it is way easier due to its automatic memory handling, syntax and multitude of external libraries.
                        Currently, I am learning to use Python more in web and game development.

                        I am looking forward to expand my knowledge by learning more about the backend part, namely to learn Javascript
                        (and Java as well).

                                    I had been playing football for 10 years before I started University. I used to play for

                                    a football club from my hometown, Arad. Now I only play once in a while, as a hobby.

                                    I enjoy skiing so much despite the fact that, during most of my childhood, I was not able to do this
                                    since the winter breaks were for hard trainings with the football team for the upcoming matches. Now,
                                    there are no more strict training schedules so I afford to go skiing in winter. The image is taken
